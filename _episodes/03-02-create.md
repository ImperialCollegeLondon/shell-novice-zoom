title: "Working With Files and Directories - Part 2"
teaching: 30
exercises: 20
questions:
- "How can I create, copy, and delete files and directories?"
- "How can I edit files?"
objectives:
- "Create a directory hierarchy that matches a given diagram."
- "Create files in that hierarchy using an editor or by copying and renaming existing files."
- "Delete, copy and move specified files and/or directories."
keypoints:
- "`cp old new` copies a file."
- "`mkdir path` creates a new directory."
- "`mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory."
- "`rm path` removes (deletes) a file."
- "`*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`."
- "`?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`."
- "Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including `Ctrl-X`, `Control-X`, and `^X`."
- "The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone."
- "Most files' names are `something.extension`. The extension isn't required, and doesn't guarantee anything, but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file."
- "Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano."

## Removing files and directories

Returning to the `data-shell` directory,
let's tidy up this directory by removing the `quotes.txt` file we created.
The Unix command we'll use for this is `rm` (short for 'remove'):

~~~
$ rm quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

We can confirm the file has gone using `ls`:

~~~
$ ls quotes.txt
~~~
{: .language-bash}

```
ls: cannot access 'quotes.txt': No such file or directory
```
{: .output}

> ## Deleting Is Forever
>
> The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted
> files from (though most graphical interfaces to Unix do).  Instead,
> when we delete files, they are unlinked from the file system so that
> their storage space on disk can be recycled. Tools for finding and
> recovering deleted files do exist, but there's no guarantee they'll
> work in any particular situation, since the computer may recycle the
> file's disk space right away.
{: .callout}

> > The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever.
> > By using the `-i` option, we have the chance to check that we are deleting only the files that we want to remove.

If we try to remove the `thesis` directory using `rm thesis`,
we get an error message:

~~~
$ rm thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

~~~
rm: cannot remove `thesis': Is a directory
~~~
{: .error}

This happens because `rm` by default only works on files, not directories.

`rm` can remove a directory *and all its contents* if we use the
recursive option `-r`, and it will do so *without any confirmation prompts*:

~~~
$ rm -r thesis
~~~
{: .language-bash}

Given that there is no way to retrieve files deleted using the shell,
`rm -r` *should be used with great caution* (you might consider adding the interactive option `rm -r -i`).

## Operations with multiple files and directories

Oftentimes one needs to copy or move several files at once. This can be done by providing a list of individual filenames, or specifying a naming pattern using wildcards.

> ## Copy with Multiple Filenames
>
> For this exercise, you can test the commands in the `data-shell/data` directory.
>
> In the example below, what does `cp` do when given several filenames and a directory name?
>
> ~~~
> $ mkdir backup
> $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt backup/
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> In the example below, what does `cp` do when given three or more file names?
>
> ~~~
> $ ls -F
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
> ~~~
> amino-acids.txt  animals.txt  backup/  elements/  morse.txt  pdb/  planets.txt  salmon.txt  sunspot.txt
> ~~~
> {: .output}
> ~~~
> $ cp amino-acids.txt animals.txt morse.txt
> ~~~
> {: .language-bash}
>
> > ## Solution
> > If given more than one file name followed by a directory name (i.e. the destination directory must
> > be the last argument), `cp` copies the files to the named directory.
> >
> > If given three file names, `cp` throws an error such as the one below, because it is expecting a directory
> > name as the last argument.

### Using wildcards for accessing multiple files at once

> ## Wildcards
>
> `*` is a **wildcard**, which matches zero or more  characters.
> Let's consider the `data-shell/molecules` directory:
> `*.pdb` matches `ethane.pdb`, `propane.pdb`, and every
> file that ends with '.pdb'. On the other hand, `p*.pdb` only matches
> `pentane.pdb` and `propane.pdb`, because the 'p' at the front only
> matches filenames that begin with the letter 'p'.
>
> `?` is also a wildcard, but it matches exactly one character.
> So `?ethane.pdb` would match `methane.pdb` whereas
> `*ethane.pdb` matches both `ethane.pdb`, and `methane.pdb`.
>
> Wildcards can be used in combination with each other
> e.g. `???ane.pdb` matches three characters followed by `ane.pdb`,
> giving `cubane.pdb  ethane.pdb  octane.pdb`.
>
> When the shell sees a wildcard, it expands the wildcard to create a
> list of matching filenames *before* running the command that was
> asked for. As an exception, if a wildcard expression does not match
> any file, Bash will pass the expression as an argument to the command
> as it is. For example typing `ls *.pdf` in the `molecules` directory
> (which contains only files with names ending with `.pdb`) results in
> an error message that there is no file called `*.pdf`.
> However, generally commands like `wc` and `ls` see the lists of
> file names matching these expressions, but not the wildcards
> themselves. It is the shell, not the other programs, that deals with
> expanding wildcards, and this is another example of orthogonal design.
{: .callout}

> ## List filenames matching a pattern
>
> When run in the `molecules` directory, which `ls` command(s) will
> produce this output?
>
> `ethane.pdb   methane.pdb`
>
> 1. `ls *t*ane.pdb`
> 2. `ls *t?ne.*`
> 3. `ls *t??ne.pdb`
> 4. `ls ethane.*`
>
> > ## Solution
>>  The solution is `3.`
>>
>> `1.` shows all files whose names contain zero or more characters (`*`) followed by the letter `t`, then zero or more characters (`*`) followed by `ane.pdb`. This gives `ethane.pdb  methane.pdb  octane.pdb  pentane.pdb`.
>>
>> `2.` shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (`*`) followed by the letter `t`, then a single character (`?`), then `ne.` followed by zero or more characters (`*`). This will give us `octane.pdb` and `pentane.pdb` but doesn't match anything which ends in `thane.pdb`.
>>
>> `3.` fixes the problems of option 2 by matching two characters (`??`) between `t` and `ne`. This is the solution.
>>
>> `4.` only shows files starting with `ethane.`.
